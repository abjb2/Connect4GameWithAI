# Connect4GameWithAI
I managed to implement a game of Connect 4 with different game modes in different files. 
You can play the game versus a beginner AI, an Intermediate AI, a Master AI or even as two human players (player versus player). 
It, however, doesn't have an interface to select a game mode before the game starts and they are all launched from the terminal.
